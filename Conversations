Okay I'm not trying to discourage you, just offering criticism- sorry if I was harsh 
Some things to consider off the top of my head: 
- is there anything preventing homeless people from coming in to hang around other than the entrance fee? 
- themes, budget, etc 
- how will you encourage people to socialize and meet new people? Just having a joint space together might not be enough (for example, many at uconn feel like cultural centers are cliquey and already feature social structure and therefore can be unwelcoming), so what element ensures that those who come here want to make new friends if they may have little in common, there may be a need to have some group activities that are held at the center to promote social exchange (potential icebreakers), etc
