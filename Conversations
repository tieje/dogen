Okay I'm not trying to discourage you, just offering criticism- sorry if I was harsh 
Some things to consider off the top of my head: 
- is there anything preventing homeless people from coming in to hang around other than the entrance fee? 
- themes, budget, etc 
- how will you encourage people to socialize and meet new people? Just having a joint space together might not be enough (for example, many at uconn feel like cultural centers are cliquey and already feature social structure and therefore can be unwelcoming), so what element ensures that those who come here want to make new friends if they may have little in common, there may be a need to have some group activities that are held at the center to promote social exchange (potential icebreakers), etc


- Security, dress code
    - not allowed entry for smell and/or uncleanliness
    - I need to look into denying entry to homeless people
    - Denying entry to homeless people is fine because homeless people can't afford lawyers... usually
- Guided shared activities
    - Cooking
        - singles cooking night
        - couples cooking night
        - random invite cooking night for meeting new people
    - PC gaming
        - League of Legends tournament
        - Dota 2 tournament?
        - Counter-strike tournament
            - Honestly, I'm not familiar with popular FPS shooters
            - I'm not familiar with popular PC games in general
        - Competitive E-sports viewing parties
        - a projector or TV could be used to live-stream games to an audience
    - Dance
        - Open, walk-ins-welcome daily dance practice/dance circle. 
        - free entry to dance groups with the condition that they teach whoever wants to learn
            - must have designated teachers within the dance group
        - marketed, open beginner dance practice sessions every month
        - Breakdance, Capoeira, and foreign cultural dance groups can have a space to practice
    - good movie night?
        - I personally don't care about bad movies or bad movie nights but some people might
        - Personally, I'm not a huge fan of movie nights, but realistically families and communities hold one all the time
    - console-gaming show night?
        - narrative-driven, visually-stunning games like Uncharted 4 could be played like a movie by someone who understands the game really well
            - someone could play FFVII remake
        - novice players who might be good comedians could play good horror games Resident Evil 2, the remake version
    - casual console gaming tournaments?
        - There is a fighting-game community that can be appealed to but I'm not very knowledgeable about it. I'll need to ask Zamir.
        - The problem with fighting-game tournaments is that there are an incredible number of setups (TVs and consoles) that must be set up in order to get through a tournament at an acceptable rate.
    - Board and Card Games
        - random invite board game night for meeting new people
        - Beginner Card Game night for learning how to play card games from our generation
            - Ask people to donate cards pokemon, yugioh, and magic cards?
            - Pokemon, Yugioh, magic, and normal playing card games
    - Instead of a vanity, there could be a perch/raised platform for people to look out from.
        - uses a circular staircase. Allows for a bird's-eye view of the place.
        - height artificially increases a sense of danger and potential
        - it's good for introducing new people
        - people could potentially play music, but honestly it's not meant for playing music
        - there is some level of privacy and intimacy with people who go up there
        - secret escape hatch underneath the raised platform.
    - Talent show?
    - Holiday themes?
    - Personally, I hate ice-breaker activities. I don't find them fun because there is clearly specific method of "winning" and it's dependent on personality type.
        I don't want to hold people's hands in this way.
    - Learning how to use Linux, Learning how to code, informal classes/lectures


- There must be a balance between guided and unguided activities. Too many guided activities and it will feel like hand-holding. Not enough guided activities and people will struggle to form communities.
