Ideas

- hire a lead teaching cook and an assistant sociologist?


- cultural development
    - if there are x or less people in the place at any time, entry is free or reduced price
        # incentivizes people to come in early despite not a lot of other people being there yet
    - might want to hire a sociologist/clinical psychologist to conduct guided cooking activities


- a dance floor
    - open to free dance practice during the day
        - mostly breakdance
    - The dance floor will have light wood to encourage spontaneity
    - Ideally, I'd like to be able to roll out a pressure-sensitive light-up dance floor and a disco ball for a club feeling
- a U table in the center for people to socialize and play 1-on-1 games or to chat
    - this is a general help desk as well

- 12 gaming PC set up
    - special gaming sessions for team-based online games like league of legends and counter-strike
    - all PCs have RGB
    - theme is post-modern: post modern means using intertextuality.
    - one set of wooden chairs blue, the other set of wooden chairs is red
        - blue vs red theme
        - the chairs are comfortable for an hour, but eventually they should hurt your butt so you're not incentivized to be on the computer for long periods of time.
    - table
        - tables match the chairs. One table is blue while the other red.
    - blue side has modern, straight-edged furniture
    - red side has rustic, curvy furniture


- an open kitchen to use
    - pay for what you use
    - pay at market price instead of price-gouging customers
    - fridge is locked without permission from kitchen supervisor
    - non-alcoholic or bring your own but must register and cannot serve to minors
    - must sign a waiver that says we are not responsible for anything and you agree to abide by our rules
    - theme
        - there will be a granite counter top for people to show-off cooking
        - the outside will have homey bright feeling while the inside has metallic, industrial cooking feeling
        - inside is where the food will be

- Cafe Area next to the kitchen to eat food and to socialize
    - half homey and clean
    - half restaurant and grungy
    - the grungy cafe area is next to the cleaning supplies and PC gaming area. There is a transition from homey to cyber-punk.

- Quiet rooms
    - Board game room
    - Vanity makeup room
    - small quiet rooms
    - the homey style of the kitchen gives way to the hollywood glam of the vanity room
    - the vanity transitions into the board game room like black and white chess pieces -- light goes to gray
    - makeup vanity
        - five vanities. Two of them will have sinks in the back of the room.
        - must offer a limited supply of makeups that exclusively use chemicals that are easily washed away by solvents for the brushes
        - theme is full on glam dimly lit room with light coming from lightbulbs around mirrors. Brightness of the lightbulbs must be controllable.


- Console gaming place
    - multiplayer gamer area
    - backseat gamer area people
    - The speakers and walls are set up in such a way that only people on the couch hear most of what's going on in the game.
        - speakers are set up behind the couch. The wall is noise-defusing.
    - the grayness is continued down into the console gaming area where the theme is neutral and morally gray, bending what is private and what is public, what is wrong and what is right

Decoration ideas:
- Quiet rooms are made to be quiet or relatively quiet
    - Accomplished by using black foam spikes on the walls
- Dark side and light side
-removeable walls for the dance area and the board game and vanity area
- low walls for the pc gaming area
