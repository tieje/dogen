Looking at food subscription numbers, they are relatively unsuccessful at turning a profit. There hightest sales point of Blue Apron was in 2017, but it has since been decreasing. The entire industry has been losing subscriptions.
Problems: it may have taught a lot of people how to cook, therefore people don't need to rely on this anymore.
It's important to recognize that the business that I'm focusing on is taken as a starting point for many people.
    - People will eventually find friends, form friend groups and engage in different activities.
    - It's important to understand the consumer life cycle.
