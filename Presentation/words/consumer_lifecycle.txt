The consumer life-cycle of this business:

1. Looking for people.
2. Relationships mature into friendships.
3. Friends engage in activities not related to our business.
4. Maturation of relationships:
    CASE I: Friends may exclusively remain friends for life OR
    CASE II: Relationships mature to such a point that they seek meeting new people and forming new friendships.
        A. Complete maturation of relationships includes the following:
            - Breakups
            - Mutual understandings
            - Relationships mature when the lesson is learned: when the personal narrative that began with meeting someone ends because there is either nothing else to learn from them, or people grow in different ways that cause the relationship to lose its value.
                - Either stagnation or diminishing returns
5. Looking for people.
